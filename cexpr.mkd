# Constant Expressions

- expressions required to be integer constant expressons 6.6p6 (CTD)

- constant expressions in initializers 6.6p7 (CTD)

- arithmetic constant expression 6.6p8 (CTD)

- address constant 6.6p9 (CTD)


## Issues

* definition of constant expressions based on UB
* UB at translation time
* when are constant expressions allowed to be evaluated?
